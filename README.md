# Home Energy Model (HEM) engine written in Rust

## Running the engine

Requires the `rustup` toolchain to use. ([Instructions](https://rustup.rs) for installation. For MacOS, don't use
Homebrew to install Rust.)

To run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

Fully running the engine requires a weather file in EPW format and an input JSON file (format not yet documented/
stable):

```
cargo run --release --features="clap indicatif" -- path/to/input.json -e path/to/weather_file.epw
```

The `clap` feature above is mandatory. The `indicatif` feature switches on the output of a progress bar.

## Contributing

### Using the commit template

If you've done work in a pair or ensemble why not add your co-author(s) to the commit? This way everyone involved is
given credit and people know who they can approach for questions about specific commits. To make this easy there is a
commit template with a list of regular contributors to this code base. You will find it at the root of this
project: `commit_template.txt`. Each row represents a possible co-author, however everyone is commented out by default (
using `#`), and any row that is commented out will not show up in the commit.

#### Editing the template

If your name is not in the `commit_template.txt` yet, edit the file and add a new row with your details, following the
format `#Co-Authored-By: Name <email>`, e.g. `#Co-Authored-By: Maja <maja@gmail.com>`. The email must match the email
you use for your GitHub account. To protect your privacy, you can activate and use your noreply GitHub addresses (find
it in GitHub under Settings > Emails > Keep my email addresses private).

#### Getting set up

To apply the commit template navigate to the root of the project in a terminal and
use: `git config commit.template commit_template.txt`. This will edit your local git config for the project and apply
the template to every future commit.

#### Using the template (committing with co-authors)

When creating a new commit, edit your commit (e.g. using vim, or a code editor) and delete the `#` in front of any
co-author(s) you want to credit. This means that it's probably easier and quicker to use `git commit` (instead
of `git commit -m ""` followed by a `git commit --amend`), as it will show you the commit template content for you to
edit.
